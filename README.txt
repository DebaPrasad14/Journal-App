			Steps for successfull run of Journal app
***********************************************************************************************************


1. At first create a folder AND then put this journal-app.py file as well as this README.txt(optional).
2. Then go to the newly created folder.
3. In that folder, run the python file as python journal-app.py or py journal-app.py

4. Then choose the options whether to register/login/exit 
	@ options (in select option) -
        write 1 or register - to register user
        write 2 or login - to login user into the system
        write 3 or exit  - to exit from the application

In options user can enter either in lowercase or uppercase letter or can choose numbers provided. 

5. After registering, user will be signed in to the system
6. Then after signin user will be asked what he/she wants to do.

7. After that choose the options whether to view old journals/ create new journal/ logout.
	@ options (in select option) -
        write 1 or view - to see previous/old journals
        write 2 or create - to create new journal
        write 3 or logout - to logout from the application

8. Then user can ENJOY the functionality of the application.

Notes: 
	1. when user will run journal-app.py file then after registration, in the same folder accountfile.txt file will be created.
	   (which is for storing username and passwords of users and also used for verifying username/password match or not)

	2. Each time a new user registers, a separate folder will be created in the same folder
	   And within that folder when that user creates journal a journal file will be created named username.txt

	   for example - if username entered is dev, then journal file name will be dev.txt
